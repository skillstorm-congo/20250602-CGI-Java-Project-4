# Project: Employee Timecard Tracking System 

### **Project Objective** 
Create a full-stack web application that will facilitate employee time tracking and management, enabling both employees and managers to efficiently manage work hours and pay stubs.

- Employees will be able to log onto their accounts to view their timesheets, paystubs, log hours and request time off
- Managers, in addition to employee permissions, will be able to view timesheets of all employees, approve or reject timesheets as well as time off requests.
- Permissions under authentication security features will allow employees to only view details and features based on their status.
